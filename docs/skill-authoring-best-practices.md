# Skill authoring best practices

Learn how to write effective Skills that Claude can discover and use successfully.

---

Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that Claude can discover and use effectively.

For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Core principles

### Concise is key

The [context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else Claude needs to know, including:
- The system prompt
- Conversation history
- Other Skills' metadata
- Your actual request

Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Claude reads SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and reads additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once Claude loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context.

**Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart

Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information:
- "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
- "Can I assume Claude knows this?"
- "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good example: Concise** (approximately 50 tokens):

```markdown
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
```

**Bad example: Too verbose** (approximately 150 tokens):

```markdown
## Extract PDF text

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains
text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to
use a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we
recommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well.
First, you'll need to install it using pip. Then you can use the code below...
```

The concise version assumes Claude knows what PDFs are and how libraries work.

### Set appropriate degrees of freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability.

**High freedom** (text-based instructions):

Use when:
- Multiple approaches are valid
- Decisions depend on context
- Heuristics guide the approach

Example:

```markdown
## Code review process

1. Analyze the code structure and organization
2. Check for potential bugs or edge cases
3. Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
4. Verify adherence to project conventions
```

**Medium freedom** (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):

Use when:
- A preferred pattern exists
- Some variation is acceptable
- Configuration affects behavior

Example:

```markdown
## Generate report

Use this template and customize as needed:

```python
def generate_report(data, format="markdown", include_charts=True):
    # Process data
    # Generate output in specified format
    # Optionally include visualizations
```
```

**Low freedom** (specific scripts, few or no parameters):

Use when:
- Operations are fragile and error-prone
- Consistency is critical
- A specific sequence must be followed

Example:

```markdown
## Database migration

Run exactly this script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup
```

Do not modify the command or add additional flags.
```

**Analogy**: Think of Claude as a robot exploring a path:
- **Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides**: There's only one safe way forward. Provide specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom). Example: database migrations that must run in exact sequence.
- **Open field with no hazards**: Many paths lead to success. Give general direction and trust Claude to find the best route (high freedom). Example: code reviews where context determines the best approach.

### Test with all models you plan to use

Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with.

**Testing considerations by model**:
- **Claude Haiku** (fast, economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
- **Claude Sonnet** (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient?
- **Claude Opus** (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?

What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them.

## Skill structure

> **YAML Frontmatter**: The SKILL.md frontmatter requires two fields:
>
> `name`:
> - Maximum 64 characters
> - Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
> - Cannot contain XML tags
> - Cannot contain reserved words: "anthropic", "claude"
>
> `description`:
> - Must be non-empty
> - Maximum 1024 characters
> - Cannot contain XML tags
> - Should describe what the Skill does and when to use it
>
> For complete Skill structure details, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure).

### Naming conventions

Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We recommend using **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the activity or capability the Skill provides.

Remember that the `name` field must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

**Good naming examples (gerund form)**:
- `processing-pdfs`
- `analyzing-spreadsheets`
- `managing-databases`
- `testing-code`
- `writing-documentation`

**Acceptable alternatives**:
- Noun phrases: `pdf-processing`, `spreadsheet-analysis`
- Action-oriented: `process-pdfs`, `analyze-spreadsheets`

**Avoid**:
- Vague names: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`
- Overly generic: `documents`, `data`, `files`
- Reserved words: `anthropic-helper`, `claude-tools`
- Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection

Consistent naming makes it easier to:
- Reference Skills in documentation and conversations
- Understand what a Skill does at a glance
- Organize and search through multiple Skills
- Maintain a professional, cohesive skill library

### Writing effective descriptions

The `description` field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it.

> **Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.
>
> - **Good:** "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
> - **Avoid:** "I can help you process Excel files"
> - **Avoid:** "You can use this to process Excel files"

**Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

Each Skill has exactly one description field. The description is critical for skill selection: Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills. Your description must provide enough detail for Claude to know when to select this Skill, while the rest of SKILL.md provides the implementation details.

Effective examples:

**PDF Processing skill:**

```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Excel Analysis skill:**

```yaml
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.
```

**Git Commit Helper skill:**

```yaml
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

Avoid vague descriptions like these:

```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```

```yaml
description: Processes data
```

```yaml
description: Does stuff with files
```

### Progressive disclosure patterns

SKILL.md serves as an overview that points Claude to detailed materials as needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide. For an explanation of how progressive disclosure works, see [How Skills work](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the overview.

**Practical guidance:**
- Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
- Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively

## Best practices

### Create verifiable intermediate outputs

When Claude performs complex, open-ended tasks, it can make mistakes. The "plan-validate-execute" pattern catches errors early by having Claude first create a plan in a structured format, then validate that plan with a script before executing it.

**Why this pattern works:**
- **Catches errors early**: Validation finds problems before changes are applied
- **Machine-verifiable**: Scripts provide objective verification
- **Reversible planning**: Claude can iterate on the plan without touching originals
- **Clear debugging**: Error messages point to specific problems

**When to use**: Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-stakes operations.

**Implementation tip**: Make validation scripts verbose with specific error messages like "Field 'signature_date' not found. Available fields: customer_name, order_total, signature_date_signed" to help Claude fix issues.

### Package dependencies

Skills run in the code execution environment with platform-specific limitations:

- **claude.ai**: Can install packages from npm and PyPI and pull from GitHub repositories
- **Anthropic API**: Has no network access and no runtime package installation

List required packages in your SKILL.md and verify they're available in the [code execution tool documentation](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool).

### Runtime environment

Skills run in a code execution environment with filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities. For the conceptual explanation of this architecture, see [The Skills architecture](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#the-skills-architecture) in the overview.

**How Claude accesses Skills:**

1. **Metadata pre-loaded**: At startup, the name and description from all Skills' YAML frontmatter are loaded into the system prompt
2. **Files read on-demand**: Claude uses bash Read tools to access SKILL.md and other files from the filesystem when needed
3. **Scripts executed efficiently**: Utility scripts can be executed via bash without loading their full contents into context. Only the script's output consumes tokens
4. **No context penalty for large files**: Reference files, data, or documentation don't consume context tokens until actually read

**File organization tips:**
- **File paths matter**: Claude navigates your skill directory like a filesystem. Use forward slashes (`reference/guide.md`), not backslashes
- **Name files descriptively**: Use names that indicate content: `form_validation_rules.md`, not `doc2.md`
- **Organize for discovery**: Structure directories by domain or feature
  - Good: `reference/finance.md`, `reference/sales.md`
  - Bad: `docs/file1.md`, `docs/file2.md`
- **Bundle comprehensive resources**: Include complete API docs, extensive examples, large datasets; no context penalty until accessed
- **Prefer scripts for deterministic operations**: Write `validate_form.py` rather than asking Claude to generate validation code
- **Make execution intent clear**:
  - "Run `analyze_form.py` to extract fields" (execute)
  - "See `analyze_form.py` for the extraction algorithm" (read as reference)
- **Test file access patterns**: Verify Claude can navigate your directory structure by testing with real requests

**Example:**

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview, points to reference files)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue metrics)
    ├── sales.md (pipeline data)
    └── product.md (usage analytics)
```

When the user asks about revenue, Claude reads SKILL.md, sees the reference to `reference/finance.md`, and invokes bash to read just that file. The sales.md and product.md files remain on the filesystem, consuming zero context tokens until needed.

### MCP tool references

If your Skill uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, always use fully qualified tool names to avoid "tool not found" errors.

**Format**: `ServerName:tool_name`

**Example**:

```markdown
Use the BigQuery:bigquery_schema tool to retrieve table schemas.
Use the GitHub:create_issue tool to create issues.
```

Where:
- `BigQuery` and `GitHub` are MCP server names
- `bigquery_schema` and `create_issue` are the tool names within those servers

Without the server prefix, Claude may fail to locate the tool, especially when multiple MCP servers are available.

### Avoid assuming tools are installed

Don't assume packages are available:

**Bad example: Assumes installation**:

```
"Use the pdf library to process the file."
```

**Good example: Explicit about dependencies**:

```markdown
"Install required package: `pip install pypdf`

Then use it:

```python
from pypdf import PdfReader
reader = PdfReader("file.pdf")
```
```

## Technical notes

### YAML frontmatter requirements

The SKILL.md frontmatter requires `name` and `description` fields with specific validation rules:
- `name`: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words
- `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

See the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure) for complete structure details.

### Token budgets

Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance. If your content exceeds this, split it into separate files using the progressive disclosure patterns described earlier. For architectural details, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work).
